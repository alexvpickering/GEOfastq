Description: GEOfastq is used to download fastq files from the European 
  Nucleotide Archive (ENA) starting with an accession from the Gene Expression 
  Omnibus (GEO). To do this, sample metadata is retrieved from GEO and the 
  Sequence Read Archive (SRA). SRA run accessions are then used to construct FTP
  and aspera download links for fastq files generated by the ENA.
